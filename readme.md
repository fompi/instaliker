## Instaliker

Like hashtags on Instagram on a schedule.

1. Install Python 3

Go to https://www.python.org and download python 3+
When installing make sure to ADD TO PATH (very important)


2. Install dependencies

Open up a terminal/command prompt and enter these separately followed by ENTER (you'll see stuff installing)

    pip install InstagramApi
    pip install schedule


3. Open up run.py in a text editor and enter your details

DO NOT use notepad on Windows as it's not a code editor and it'll break everything
I recommend notepad++ or Atom


4. Run it

In a terminal/command prompt navigate to where run.py is (cd = change directory)

    cd Desktop
    cd instaliker
    python run.py
